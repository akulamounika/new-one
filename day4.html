    <h2> Career</h2>
    <hr>
    <h2>Netscape </h2>
    <p> Eich started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995. Eich originally joined intending to
        put Scheme "in the browser", but his Netscape superiors <br>insisted that the language's syntax resemble that
        of
        Java. As a result, Eich devised a language that had much of the functionality of Scheme, the
        object-orientation
        of <br>Self, and the syntax of Java.<mark> He completed the first version in ten days</mark> in order to
        accommodate
        the
        Navigator 2.0 Beta releases schedule, and was called Mocha<br> but renamed LiveScript in September 1995 and
        finally in a joint announcement with Sun Microsystem it was named JavaScript in December.<br>
        Simultaneously,
        <i style="color:rgb(184, 133, 23)">he designed the first SpiderMonkey engine for the Netscape Navigator</i>
        browser
        at Netscape Communications.
    </p>
    <h2>Mozilla </h2>
    <p>In early 1998, Eich co-founded the free and open source software project Mozilla with Jamie Zawinski and others,
        creating the mozilla.org website, which<br> was meant to manage open-source contributions to the Netscape source
        code. He served as Mozilla's chief architect.AOL bought Netscape in 1999.<br> After AOL shut down the
        Netscape
        browser unit in July 2003, Eich helped spin out the Mozilla Foundation.</p>
    <h2> Brave Software</h2>
    <p> Eich is the CEO of Brave Software, an Internet browser platform company that raised $2.5 million in early
        funding from angel investors. In January <br>2016, the company released developer versions of its open-source,
        Chromium-based Brave web browser, which blocks ads and trackers.</p>
